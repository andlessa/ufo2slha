#MG5 Cards:
paramcard = inputCards/param_card-littleHiggs.dat ; Path to the default parameter_card.dat to be used by MadGraph. Note that the parameter values defined in the MadGraphSet section below will automatically overwrite the values in paramcard. If not defined, the default file for the model will be used.
runcard = inputCards/run_card.dat ; Path to the default run_card.dat to be used by MadGraph. Note that the parameter values defined in the MadGraphSet section below will automatically overwrite the values in runcard. If not defined, the default file for the model will be used.
#proccard = inputCards/proc_card.dat ; Path to the default proc_card.dat to be used by MadGraph. If not defined, a process card will be automatically created using for computing the cross-section and decays according to the options set in [options]. 
processFolder = outputDir/MG5_output/proc-littleHiggs ;Path to the folder to store the process generation output. If it already exists, the process generation will be skipped, reducing the running time.
MG5path = MG5 ;Path to the MadGraph5 folder
mg5out = None ;Temporary output folder to store MadGraph output. It will be removed at the end of the run if cleanOutFolders = True. If not defined or None, a temporary folder will be automatically created.

ebeam1 = $loop{[4000,6500]} ; Sets the beam energy. The $loop{list} syntax will create an SLHA file for each value in the list. If several parameters are set as $loop{list}, SLHA files will be generated for all possible combinations of parameters.
ebeam2 = ${ebeam1}
MHd = $loop{[1000.,2000.]}  ; Sets the model parameter value (can be any parameter appearing in the UFO model and should follow the same naming convention). In this example 4 SLHA files will be created: MHd_1000_8TeV, MHd_1000_13TeV, MHd_2000_8TeV and MHd_2000_13TeV
