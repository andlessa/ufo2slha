# ufo2slha
This repository holds the code for producing a SLHA file from an UFO input model.

## Basic Installation ##

The following external codes are required:

  * [MadGraph](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo)

The script installer.sh will try to fetch the appropriate tarballs and try to install them.
A few patches will be automatically applied to the MadGraph installation in order to allow for the automatized computation
of cross-sections. *Therefore we do not recommend to use an external MadGraph installation.*
The modified files can be found in [madgraphFixes](madgraphFixes).


### Generating SLHA files ###

A SLHA file for any input model and set of parameters can be 
obtained running:

``
./createSLHA.py -p <parameter file>
`` 
The parameter file specificies several options for computing the cross-sections and the decays.
An example with comments can be found in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini).

#### SLHA creation Steps ####

The creation of an SLHA file from the UFO input is done according to the following steps:
  1. If a process card is defined and it already exists (see proccard in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)), 
     this file will be used to generate the madgraph processes. Otherwise
     a process card will be autmatically created to generate all p p -> 2 processes using the particles listed in computeXsecsFor.
     The output will be saved  to the process folder 
     (defined by processFolder in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)). If the process folder
     already exists, the process generation will be skipped.
  2. Once the information about the processes are stored in the process folder (see above), this folder will be copied
     to the madgraph output folder (see mg5out in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)).
  3. Events will then be generated using the parameters set by the "MadGraphSet" section in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)
     and the run and parameter cards defined by the runcard and paramcard options. If these are not defined or the files
     do not exist, the default files will be used.
  4. Finally the LHE event file generated by madgraph (specified by the ''inputFile'' option in the ''slhaCreator'' section 
     in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)) will be read and used to extract the cross-sections and the other SLHA blocks, which will then
     be written to the output slha file (defined by the ''slhaout'' option in the "slhaCreator" section 
     in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini))
  5. If cleanOutFolders = True, the madgraph output folder will be deleted.
