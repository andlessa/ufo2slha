# ufo2slha
This repository holds the code for producing slha files from UFO files.
Currently it is only implemented for a Little Higgs model.


## Basic Installation ##

The following external codes are required:

  * [MadGraph](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo)

The script installer.sh will try to fetch the appropriate tarballs and try to install them.


### Generating SLHA files ###

The cross-sections for the MSSM scenario can be computed as usual with smodelsTools.py.
However, for the IDM model MadGraph5 must be used. Running:

``
./createSLHA.py -p <parameter file>
`` 

will use the parameters defined in the parameter file (see example in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)).

#### SLHA creation Steps ####

The creation of an SLHA file from the UFO input is done according to the following steps:
  1. If a process card is defined and it already exists (see proccard in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)), 
     this file will be used to generate the madgraph processes. Otherwise
     a process card will be autmatically created to generate all p p -> 2 processes using the particles listed in computeXsecsFor.
     The output will be saved  to the process folder 
     (defined by processFolder in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)). If the process folder
     already exists, the process generation will be skipped.
  2. Once the information about the processes are stored in the process folder (see above), this folder will be copied
     to the madgraph output folder (see mg5out in [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)).
  3. Events will then be generated using the parameters set by the "MadGraphSet" section in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)
     and the run and parameter cards defined by the runcard and paramcard options. If these are not defined or the files
     do not exist, the default files will be used.
  4. Finally the LHE event file generated by madgraph (defined by the ''inputFile'' option in the "slhaCreator" section 
     in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini)) will be read and used to extract the cross-sections, which will then
     be written to the output slha file (defined by the ''slhaout'' option in the "slhaCreator" section 
     in  [slha_parameters.ini](slha_parameters.ini))
  5. If cleanOutFolders = True, the madgraph output folder will be deleted.

The outout SLHA file with cross-sections can then be used as input to SModelS.
